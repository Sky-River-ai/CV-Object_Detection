Developed a computer vision model which identifies traffic objects including 'bicycles', 'buses', 'crosswalks', 'fire hydrants', 'motorcycles', 'traffic lights', 'vehicles'.
Model successfully identifies all the given classes in each respective Frame.
Used YOLOv8 which primarily uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. CNNs are well-suited for tasks like image and video processing.
